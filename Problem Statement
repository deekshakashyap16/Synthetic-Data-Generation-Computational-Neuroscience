Bridging the Data Gap in Motor Imagery for Next-Gen Prosthetic Control
Problem Statement
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for prosthetic control rely on motor imagery EEG, where users imagine movements to control artificial limbs. However, existing models struggle with accuracy due to the limited availability of high-quality motor imagery data. Unlike motor movement EEG, which has strong, consistent signals, motor imagery EEG is weaker, highly variable, and difficult to classify.

The Gap: Why Is This a Challenge?
Limited Datasets – Most existing EEG datasets focus on motor movement, leaving motor imagery underrepresented.

High Variability – Imagined movements differ from person to person, making it harder for ML models to generalize.

Lack of Synthetic Data – Training deep learning models requires large datasets, but collecting motor imagery EEG is expensive and time-consuming.

Our Objective
We aim to generate high-quality synthetic motor imagery EEG data to bridge this gap. By using advanced AI techniques, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or Diffusion Models, we can create realistic EEG signals that mimic real motor imagery patterns. This will help:

Enhance training datasets for ML models.

Improve prosthetic control accuracy for completely paralyzed individuals.

Reduce dependency on extensive real-world EEG recordings.

Impact & Future Applications
Neuroengineering Labs: Can use synthetic EEG data to test and refine BCI models.

Prosthetics Development: Better AI models can enable smoother, more intuitive control for prosthetic limbs.

Assistive Tech Innovation: This research can lead to applications beyond prosthetics, such as wheelchair control and robotic assistance for paralyzed users.

Conclusion
By generating synthetic motor imagery EEG, we provide a scalable, cost-effective solution for training ML models. Our work will accelerate prosthetic advancements, making BCI-driven artificial limbs more accurate, responsive, and accessible for individuals with complete paralysis.
