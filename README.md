Enhancing Brain-Controlled Prosthetics
Why? BCIs for prosthetic limbs rely on real-time EEG/ECoG data, which is often noisy and incomplete.

Use Case: Synthetic data could help train ML models to predict motor commands more accurately.

Who Will Use It? Neuroengineering labs, prosthetics manufacturers, assistive technology developers.
